        <h2>It all started here.</h2>
        <p>Back in December 2013 I volunteered to help update content on a subreddit called /r/loleventvods, at the time eventvods was only covering league of legends (hence the "lol"). Things started off slow but at the same time was very hectic, heading
          straight into off-season I was among a handful of people who took things more or less seriously than I did. Once Spring split 2014 began I was updating and covering multiple leagues and dozens of games a split.</p>


      <p>After spring 2014 things began to ramp up, league started gaining popularity at an exponential rate and that meant a lot more people wanted spoiler-free vods. We began experimenting and expanding our base into other established e-sports as well
        including; dota 2, CS:GO and even heartstone. Our goal was simple. Become the premiere content provider for all spoiler-free vods across all e-sports. There was just one problem, we didn't have the manpower to sustain such a model. So we looked
        towards moving our base of operations off reddit and into our own website. This would allow us to have full control over our own content.
        </p><p>

          <h3>Our first 3 goals</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Topple all other youtube channel competitors</li>
            <li>Establish a line of communication with all event organizers</li>
            <li>Create original content that would increase viewership and our viewerbase</li>
          </ol>

          <hr>

          <h3>Our biggest challenges</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Having consistent, reliable content updaters</li>
            <li>Keeping up with all the scheduling of e-sport events across all games</li>
            <li>Dealing with reddit's limited subreddit functions</li>
          </ul>
